**TL;DR** The Federal Reserve targets 2% inflation. Since 2000 the S&P 500 has only fallen in seven out of twenty four years (about 29%). The index returned roughly 6.4% per year on average, so the 2% inflation drift amounts to a 31% head start on each year's gains.
:::

## Drift as Policy

When central bankers aim for 2% inflation, they effectively build a gentle upward drift into nominal prices. This background push makes negative market years relatively uncommon over long periods.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
from scripts.plot_style import set_plot_style
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

set_plot_style()

url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasets/s-and-p-500/master/data/data.csv"
# load monthly data and compute year-end levels
all_data = pd.read_csv(url, parse_dates=["Date"])
use = all_data[all_data["Date"] >= "1999-01-01"]
annual = use.set_index("Date")["SP500"].resample("Y").last()

# returns for 2000 onward
returns = annual.pct_change().dropna()
returns = returns[returns.index.year >= 2000]

down_years = returns[returns < 0]
down_pct = len(down_years) / len(returns) * 100
avg_return = returns.mean() * 100
head_start = 2 / avg_return * 100

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8,4))
ax.plot(annual.index.year, annual.values, marker="o", label="Year-end close")
ax.scatter(down_years.index.year, annual.loc[down_years.index], color="red", label="Down year")
ax.set_title("S&P 500 Year-End Levels")
ax.set_ylabel("Index level")
ax.set_xlabel("Year")
ax.legend()
plt.tight_layout()
fig
```

```{python}
print(f"Down years: {len(down_years)} out of {len(returns)} ({down_pct:.1f}% of the time)")
print(f"Average annual return: {avg_return:.2f}%")
print(f"2% / average return = {head_start:.1f}% head start")
```

The S&P 500 closed lower than the prior year in only around 29% of years since 2000. With average gains near 6% per year, the Fed's 2% inflation drift provides a material boost before companies even grow earnings.
