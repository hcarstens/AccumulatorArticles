## 1 Supply, Demand, and the Special Case of a Fixed Supply

* **Standard model.** Price adjusts so that quantity supplied equals quantity demanded  
  \\(Q_s(P) = Q_d(P)\\).

* **Fixed‑supply scenario.** Suppose total supply is capped (land, Bitcoin, seats in a stadium).  
  Price has to do *all* the work: any outward shift in demand shows up as a higher equilibrium price,
  because \\(Q_s\\) cannot rise.

> **Key takeaway:** with a vertical supply curve, even small demand growth turns into steep price appreciation.

## 2 Illustrative model — 2 % continuous demand growth

We start at an equilibrium price of \$10 and supply of 100 units.  
Demand shifts outward at 2 % per period:

$$ D_t(P) = (1+g)^t\,D_0(P),\quad g=0.02 $$

Below, we solve for the new price each period and plot the path.

```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Parameters
Qs = 100           # fixed supply (units)
P0 = 10            # initial equilibrium price
g  = 0.02          # 2 % continuous demand growth
t  = np.arange(0, 25)   # 25 periods

# Linear demand curve chosen to hit (P0, Qs) at t=0:  Qd = a - bP
a = Qs + 10
b = (a - Qs) / P0

def price_path(periods):
    shift = np.exp(g * periods)      # multiplicative demand shift
    return (a * shift - Qs) / b      # new equilibrium price

prices = price_path(t)

# Plot
plt.figure()
plt.plot(t, prices, label="Equilibrium price")
plt.axhline(P0, linestyle="--", label="Initial price $10")
plt.title("Price path with 2 % demand growth & fixed supply")
plt.xlabel("Period")
plt.ylabel("Price")
plt.legend()
plt.tight_layout()
